Use a refund token

If you‚Äôre only wondering how you can earn free V-Bucks because you spent your last one on a skin that you didn‚Äôt like, fear not. All Fortnite accounts are granted three refund tokens, which allow them to return the cosmetics they bought and get back their precious V-Bucks.

This method only gives you back the V-Bucks that you spent on the skin that you return, though, and the cap on tokens will limit their usage. It‚Äôs still worth using them to get your V-Bucks back for a purchase that you weren‚Äôt satisfied with.

Every year, players will be given one refund token. This change was implemented in Patch 18.2. Before that, players would run out of refunds forever after using all of them.

Though accidental purchases happen, a refund system such as this one is necessary to prevent players from abusing the system. If that wasn‚Äôt the case, most players would purchase a skin and wear it for a few days only to refund it, which would damage Epic‚Äôs revenue stream.
Honorable mentions

These methods aren‚Äôt entirely free, but if you‚Äôre already going to spend money on Fortnite, you might as well follow them to get more bang for your buck.
Unlock the V-Bucks rewards in your battle pass

The battle pass itself costs money, but you can earn back your investment and then some. Fortnite has been allowing players to only unlock the tiers that they like in the battle pass, meaning players can unlock the V-Buck rewards immediately if they have enough Battle Stars.

Once you start profiting from your initial battle pass investment, you can save up the additional V-Bucks and use them to purchase other cosmetics that you may like.
